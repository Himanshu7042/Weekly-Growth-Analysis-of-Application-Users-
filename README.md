## Overview  
This project analyzes **weekly user growth** by categorizing users into four segments:  
- **New Users**: First-time users in a given week  
- **Retained Users**: Users who were active in the previous week and are still active  
- **Resurrected Users**: Users who were inactive in the previous week but returned  
- **Churned Users**: Users who were active previously but are no longer active  

Additionally, key growth metrics like **Retention Rate** and **Quick Ratio** are calculated to evaluate user engagement and growth trends.
